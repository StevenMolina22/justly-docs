Justly is a dispute resolution layer built for digital businesses.

As platforms grow, payments accelerate, and users become global, one challenge inevitably appears: **disputes**.

Marketplace orders go wrong.\
Freelance work is contested.\
Services don’t meet expectations.\
Digital agreements break.

Handling these conflicts internally is **expensive, slow, and risky**.

Support teams don’t scale.\
Manual reviews introduce bias.\
And platforms are forced to act as judge in disputes they didn’t create.

***

### Why Justly Exists

Justly exists to remove that burden.

Instead of building custom dispute processes from scratch, platforms can integrate Justly as a **neutral resolution layer**, handling conflicts externally, fairly, and consistently.

### Value for Businesses

Justly helps businesses:

* Resolve disputes without internal arbitration
* Reduce operational and legal overhead
* Improve trust between users
* Scale globally without turning disputes into a bottleneck

***

### Value for Users

For users, Justly creates a system where:

* Disputes are reviewed by independent participants
* Evidence matters more than influence
* Outcomes follow transparent rules rather than opaque policies

***

### Built for Both Sides

Justly is designed to serve both sides naturally.

Platforms integrate it to protect their ecosystem.\
Users engage with it knowing that fairness and accountability are part of the process.

Behind the scenes, Justly relies on **economic incentives and carefully designed coordination mechanisms**. Participants are rewarded for honest decisions, discouraged from bad behavior, and selected independently — ensuring the system remains reliable over time without requiring trust in a single authority.

#### Scope at a Conceptual Level

Justly is designed to resolve adversarial disputes arising from digital agreements and payments, where:

* There are clear parties in conflict.
* Value is at stake.
* Outcomes must be enforced automatically.

Resolution, Not Mediation Justly focuses on definitive resolution, not mediation. It is not a general-purpose legal system, a customer support replacement, or a broad governance framework. Its goal is to provide a neutral, enforceable decision layer for digital economies — independent from platforms, jurisdictions, or internal policies.

Transactional Focus & Scale Unlike universal arbitration models, Justly is optimized for high-velocity digital transactions. It focuses on micro to mid-sized disputes where technical efficiency is paramount. It is not intended for:

* High-stakes litigation: Cases of massive financial scale that require traditional legal discovery.
* Complex Human Rights or Ethics: Subjective social or political debates that fall outside the scope of transactional evidence.

The Foundational Model Different dispute types, escalation paths, and specialization layers can be built on top of this core, but all follow the same foundational model: Human Judgment + Economic Incentives + Cryptographic Enforcement.
