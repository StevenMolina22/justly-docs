#### The real problem (not a theoretical one)

On freelancer and contractor platforms, disputes are **not rare edge cases** — they are a built-in consequence of how digital work operates.

Real, everyday situations include:

* A client claims *“the work doesn’t match the original scope”*
* A contractor responds *“the scope changed during the project”*
* A client withholds payment arguing **poor quality**
* A freelancer claims the work was delivered and approved
* Deliverables are submitted, but expectations were never clearly documented

These conflicts happen **constantly**, especially in remote, asynchronous work environments.

***

#### How disputes are handled today (and why this doesn’t scale)

Most freelancer platforms resolve disputes through centralized mediation:

1. The platform holds the payment.
2. A dispute is opened through support.
3. A platform agent:
   * reviews messages and files,
   * interprets terms of service,
   * makes a subjective decision.
4. Funds are released based on that decision.

This model creates structural issues:

* ❌ **The platform acts as judge and party**\
  It decides over user funds while protecting its own interests.
* ❌ **High operational overhead**\
  Each dispute requires manual review by trained staff.
* ❌ **Subjective and inconsistent rulings**\
  Similar cases can result in different outcomes.
* ❌ **Slow resolution times**\
  Disputes can take days or weeks to resolve.

As a result:

* freelancers feel unprotected,
* clients feel decisions are arbitrary,
* trust in the platform erodes.

***

#### The key insight: escrow alone doesn’t resolve human disagreement

Freelancer platforms often rely on **payment escrow**:

* clients pay upfront,
* funds are locked,
* funds are released upon completion.

But when there’s a disagreement, escrow alone isn’t enough.

The critical question becomes:

> Was the work actually delivered as agreed?

Without a clear, fair way to answer this:

* payments get stuck,
* decisions feel arbitrary,
* disputes escalate emotionally.

👉 **Human judgment is unavoidable in creative and knowledge work.**\
Justly provides a structured way to apply it.

#### How Justly resolves disputes for freelancer platforms

Justly integrates as a **neutral, external arbitration layer**.

A typical flow:

1. The client funds the escrow.
2. Work is delivered.
3. A dispute is opened if there’s disagreement.
4. Both parties submit evidence:
   * original brief or contract,
   * deliverables,
   * communication history.
5. **Independent jurors** review the case.
6. Jurors vote based on predefined rules.
7. Funds are released automatically according to the ruling.

The platform:

* does not decide the outcome,
* does not mediate manually,
* does not bear subjective responsibility.

#### A concrete (very realistic) example

**Freelance development contract**

* Payment: 800 USDC
* Client claims: *“the feature doesn’t meet requirements”*
* Developer claims: *“the requirements changed after delivery”*

With Justly:

* Both submit:
  * the original specification,
  * the delivered code,
  * Git commits and messages.
* Jurors evaluate:
  * Was the scope clearly defined?
  * Does the delivery meet the original agreement?
* A vote is taken.
* Funds are distributed automatically based on the verdict.

No platform intervention is required.

#### Clear benefits for freelancer platforms

**For the platform**

* Reduced support and mediation costs.
* Fewer escalations and legal risks.
* Transparent, auditable decisions.
* Better scalability as the platform grows.

**For clients**

* Confidence to fund work upfront.
* Fair evaluation of deliverables.

**For freelancers**

* Protection against unfair non-payment.
* Clear, predictable dispute outcomes.

***

#### Why this matters

Without fair dispute resolution:

* high-quality freelancers leave,
* clients hesitate to prepay,
* the platform’s reputation suffers.

With Justly:

* disputes stop being platform-breaking events,
* and become a manageable, trust-preserving process.

***

*Disputes between freelancers and clients are commonly handled through **Tier 2 or Tier 3**, balancing cost efficiency with stronger economic guarantees.*
