Status: Planned (*Decision disputes with enforceable outcomes*)
</Note>

Justly is not only useful when disputes arise over payments or services.\
It also applies when **collective decisions break down**.

Governance systems — whether in DAOs, protocols, platforms, or digital communities — are built on rules, votes, and incentives. But real-world governance is messy: not every situation can be resolved by a simple on-chain vote or predefined logic.

Justly acts as a **human arbitration and coordination layer** for governance systems when rules alone are not enough.

***

### The real problem with governance systems

Most governance frameworks assume that:

* rules are clear,
* proposals are well-defined,
* voters behave rationally,
* outcomes are final.

In practice, this often fails.

Common real-world governance issues include:

* Disputes over whether a proposal was implemented correctly
* Conflicts about ambiguous rules or edge cases
* Claims that a vote was manipulated, rushed, or unfair
* Disagreements after a decision has already passed
* Minority groups contesting outcomes they believe violate shared principles
* Grant allocations perceived as biased or low-quality
* Parameter changes that negatively affect part of the community

When these conflicts arise, governance systems usually have **no built-in way to resolve them**.

***

### How governance disputes are handled today (and why it fails)

Most projects fall back to one of these options:

1. **Core team decides manually**
   * Centralized, opaque, and legitimacy is questioned.
2. **Social consensus on Discord / forums**
   * Loud minorities dominate, outcomes are unclear, decisions drag on.
3. **Re-run votes**
   * Expensive, slow, and often doesn’t resolve the underlying disagreement.
4. **Ignore the dispute**
   * Leads to frustration, forks, or community erosion.

None of these approaches scale.\
None are neutral.\
None provide enforceable outcomes.

***

### Why voting alone is not enough

Voting answers the question:

> “What do the majority want?”

But it does **not** answer:

* “Was the proposal executed correctly?”
* “Does this decision violate previously agreed rules?”
* “Is this grant actually delivering value?”
* “Is this behavior aligned with the protocol’s intent?”

Governance systems need a **dispute resolution layer**, just like escrows need arbitration.

***

### How Justly fits into governance systems

Justly integrates as a **post-vote and edge-case resolution layer**.

It does not replace:

* DAO voting,
* governance frameworks,
* protocol rules.

It activates **when those systems fail to produce a clear or accepted outcome**.

#### High-level flow

1. A governance decision is made (vote, proposal, rule).
2. A dispute arises about:
   * interpretation,
   * execution,
   * fairness,
   * or impact.
3. A dispute is opened in Justly.
4. Evidence is submitted:
   * proposal text,
   * voting results,
   * implementation details,
   * prior rules or precedents.
5. Independent jurors evaluate the case.
6. A verdict is reached.
7. The outcome:
   * resolves the dispute socially,
   * and can optionally trigger on-chain actions.

***

### Concrete governance use cases

#### 1. DAO proposal execution disputes

**Example**

A DAO approves a proposal to fund a project.\
After execution, part of the community claims the implementation deviates from what was voted.

Justly allows jurors to evaluate:

* the original proposal,
* what was delivered,
* whether the execution matches intent.

The verdict determines whether funds are released, clawed back, or execution is considered valid.

***

#### 2. Grant allocation and evaluation

Many DAOs struggle with:

* subjective grant approvals,
* favoritism,
* low-quality outcomes.

With Justly:

* grant recipients can be evaluated post-delivery,
* jurors assess whether milestones were met,
* future funding or reputation adjusts based on verdicts.

This introduces **accountability without central committees**.

***

#### 3. Parameter changes and protocol disputes

Changes to fees, limits, or economic parameters often create winners and losers.

When disputes arise:

* Justly can be used to evaluate whether changes violate prior commitments,
* or whether emergency rollbacks are justified.

This reduces emotional governance fights and adds structured resolution.

***

#### 4. Community rule enforcement

Governance is not only about money.

Disputes may involve:

* code of conduct violations,
* moderation decisions,
* abuse of governance processes.

Justly provides:

* rule-based, auditable evaluation,
* legitimacy beyond “admin decisions”.

***

### Why Justly works for governance

* **Neutrality**\
  Jurors are external and economically incentivized to be fair.
* **Legitimacy**\
  Decisions are transparent and based on shared rules.
* **Enforceability**\
  Outcomes can trigger on-chain logic or funding decisions.
* **Scalability**\
  No need for governance councils or endless debates.
* **Human judgment where it matters**\
  Without breaking decentralization.

***

### The bigger picture

Governance systems fail not because rules are bad,\
but because **rules cannot anticipate every situation**.

Justly provides the missing layer:

> A structured way for humans to resolve disagreements\
> without central authority\
> and with real consequences.

This makes governance systems **resilient**, not just decentralized.

*Governance disputes may rely on **Tier 3 or Tier 4** to provide stronger legitimacy and resistance to manipulation.*
