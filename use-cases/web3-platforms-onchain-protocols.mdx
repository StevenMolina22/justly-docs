#### The real problem in Web3 (beyond ideology)

Web3 systems are designed to be **trustless**, but real-world interactions are not.

On-chain protocols increasingly handle:

* peer-to-peer payments,
* tokenized assets,
* services exchanged for crypto,
* DAO governance actions,
* cross-protocol interactions.

Wherever **value exchange meets human behavior**, disputes inevitably arise.

***

#### Common dispute scenarios in Web3

These are not hypothetical edge cases — they happen daily:

* A DAO member claims funds were misused.
* A service provider receives payment but is accused of not delivering.
* An NFT is sold with disputed attributes or usage rights.
* An escrow contract releases funds incorrectly.
* A protocol upgrade or governance action is challenged.
* A cross-chain or DeFi interaction behaves unexpectedly.

Smart contracts execute perfectly — **but they cannot interpret context**.

***

#### The current workaround: “off-chain judgment”

Most Web3 protocols resolve disputes through:

* Discord discussions
* DAO forum debates
* Multisig discretion
* Core team intervention
* Emergency admin keys
* Social consensus

This creates contradictions:

* ❌ Protocols claim decentralization but rely on trusted actors.
* ❌ Decisions are opaque and socially enforced.
* ❌ Outcomes depend on influence, not rules.
* ❌ Legal and reputational risks accumulate off-chain.

In practice, many “trustless” systems **re-introduce trust through the back door**.

***

#### The key insight: trustless execution needs neutral judgment

Smart contracts are excellent at:

* enforcing rules,
* moving assets,
* executing deterministic logic.

They are **bad at resolving ambiguity**.

Dispute resolution is the missing primitive:

* not for every transaction,
* but for the moments when rules alone are insufficient.

👉 **Without a native dispute layer, decentralization breaks under pressure.**

***

#### How Justly integrates with Web3 protocols

Justly functions as a **protocol-agnostic dispute resolution layer**.

It can be plugged into:

* DAOs,
* DeFi protocols,
* NFT marketplaces,
* on-chain escrow systems,
* cross-protocol workflows.

A typical on-chain flow:

1. A smart contract flags a transaction or state as disputed.
2. The dispute is registered on Justly.
3. Parties submit evidence (on-chain + off-chain references).
4. Independent jurors are selected.
5. Jurors evaluate according to protocol-defined rules.
6. A ruling is returned on-chain.
7. The original contract executes the ruling automatically.

No admins. No emergency keys. No social enforcement.

***

#### Example: DAO treasury dispute

* A DAO allocates 50,000 USDC to a contributor.
* Community members dispute that milestones were not met.
* Funds are escrowed in a smart contract.
* Justly is triggered as the dispute resolver.

Jurors evaluate:

* agreed milestones,
* on-chain activity,
* submitted deliverables.

The ruling:

* releases funds,
* partially refunds,
* or returns them to the DAO treasury.

The DAO does not vote emotionally.\
The contract enforces the outcome.

***

#### Why this matters for Web3 protocols

**For protocol designers**

* Removes reliance on centralized governance interventions.
* Reduces attack surface (admin keys, multisigs).
* Enables cleaner, rule-based protocol design.

**For DAOs**

* Fair handling of internal conflicts.
* Less governance fatigue.
* Clear, enforceable outcomes.

**For users**

* Higher confidence interacting with on-chain systems.
* Protection in ambiguous situations.

***

#### Dispute resolution as a Web3 primitive

Just as:

* oracles connect blockchains to reality,
* bridges connect chains to chains,

👉 **dispute resolution connects code to human context.**

Protocols without it:

* work until something goes wrong.

Protocols with it:

* can safely scale real economic activity.

***

#### The takeaway

Web3 doesn’t fail because smart contracts are weak.\
It fails when **human disputes have nowhere to go**.

Justly provides:

* neutral judgment,
* on-chain enforceability,
* protocol-level trust.

***

*Protocol-level disputes often leverage **Tier 2 or Tier 3**, depending on the value locked and the social impact of the decision.*
