Justly is designed as a **reusable dispute resolution infrastructure**, adaptable to multiple industries where digital payments exist and low-to-medium value conflicts are frequent.

Instead of building custom dispute logic for every product or protocol, Justly provides a **neutral, fast, and programmable layer** that can be embedded wherever trust breaks down.

Below is a high-level overview of the main use cases.\
Each one is explored in depth in its own section.

***

### 1. Marketplaces (E-commerce, P2P, Services)

Marketplaces constantly deal with disputes between buyers and sellers over delivery, quality, or terms.\
Justly enables platforms to resolve these conflicts quickly and transparently without acting as judge and party.

**Core value:** faster resolutions, lower support costs, increased trust between participants.

***

### 2. Freelancer and Contractor Platforms

Disputes over scope, quality, and payments are common in freelance work, especially for small or medium amounts.\
Justly allows these conflicts to be resolved fairly in hours, and often in minutes under strong juror liquidity, without legal friction or centralized arbitration.

**Core value:** reduced friction, faster payouts, higher user retention.

***

### 3. Fintechs, Wallets, and Payment Platforms

Payment platforms face frequent disputes related to chargebacks, incorrect transfers, or peer-to-peer disagreements.\
Justly acts as a neutral dispute layer on top of payment flows, with verifiable and auditable outcomes.

**Core value:** fewer chargebacks, reduced fraud, stronger perception of fairness.

***

### 4. Web3 Platforms and On-chain Protocols

Even in decentralized systems, human disagreements still exist.\
Justly provides a human arbitration fallback that can trigger on-chain logic when smart contracts alone are not enough.

**Core value:** increased social security for protocols and better UX for non-technical users.

***

### 5. Micro-insurance and Micro-claims

Traditional insurance systems cannot profitably handle small claims.\
Justly makes real-time, low-cost evaluation possible through distributed juries and automated execution.

**Core value:** viable micro-insurance models with transparent outcomes.

***

### 6. Content Moderation and Platform Disputes

Centralized moderation often leads to distrust and backlash.\
Justly enables distributed, rule-based evaluation of moderation decisions with social legitimacy.

**Core value:** verifiable moderation and reduced perception of censorship.

***

### 7. Code Quality Evaluation and OSS Reward Distribution

Measuring the real value of code contributions is hard, and traditional metrics fail.\
Justly enables collective evaluation of code quality and impact, aligning rewards, merges, and funding with real contribution value.

**Core value:** merit-based rewards, better incentive alignment, healthier OSS ecosystems.

***

### 8. Governance and Collective Decision-Making

Governance systems often fail when rules are ambiguous, execution is contested, or outcomes are socially disputed.

Justly acts as a **post-vote and edge-case resolution layer** for DAOs, protocols, and digital communities, providing structured human judgment with enforceable outcomes.

**Core value:** legitimate, scalable governance without central authorities.

***

### Summary

Justly can be integrated into any system where:

* digital payments exist,
* low or mid-value disputes are common,
* speed, fairness, and trust are critical.

Justly is not a vertical product.\
It is **dispute resolution infrastructure for the digital economy**, extensible beyond disputes into broader coordination and quality assessment problems.
