#### The real problem (not a theoretical one)

Fintech and payment platforms handle **millions of transactions between users who don’t know each other**.\
Disputes are not edge cases — they are an inevitable byproduct of digital payments.

Common real-world scenarios include:

* A user claims *“I sent the payment, but the service was never delivered”*
* A merchant claims *“the payment was received and the service was provided”*
* A peer-to-peer transfer is marked as incorrect or unintended
* A user disputes a charge after receiving a product or service
* Cross-border payments generate misunderstandings due to timing, FX, or settlement differences

These issues occur **daily**, especially at scale.

***

#### How disputes are handled today (and why this doesn’t scale)

Most fintechs and wallets rely on **centralized dispute handling**:

1. The platform freezes the transaction.
2. A dispute or chargeback process is initiated.
3. Internal teams:
   * review transaction logs,
   * analyze user communications,
   * apply internal policies.
4. The platform decides whether to reverse or settle the payment.

This approach introduces structural problems:

* ❌ **The platform is judge and party**\
  It controls the funds and the outcome.
* ❌ **High operational and compliance costs**\
  Each dispute requires manual review and regulatory oversight.
* ❌ **Slow resolution times**\
  Chargebacks and disputes can take days or weeks.
* ❌ **Limited transparency**\
  Users don’t understand how or why decisions are made.

As transaction volume grows, these processes become **increasingly expensive and fragile**.

***

#### The key insight: payments without neutral resolution erode trust

Payments are only truly final when users trust the system.

Without a fair dispute mechanism:

* users hesitate to send money,
* merchants face uncertainty,
* platforms absorb reputational and financial risk.

Traditional chargeback systems:

* are slow,
* favor certain parties,
* and don’t work well for instant or cross-border payments.

👉 **Fast payments require equally fast and fair dispute resolution.**

***

#### How Justly fits into fintech and payment flows

Justly integrates as a **neutral dispute resolution layer on top of payment rails**.

A typical flow:

1. A payment is executed and optionally held in escrow.
2. A dispute is opened if one party challenges the transaction.
3. Both sides submit evidence:
   * transaction details,
   * service confirmation,
   * messages or receipts.
4. **Independent jurors** evaluate the case.
5. A ruling is reached based on predefined criteria.
6. Funds are released, refunded, or reassigned automatically.

Justly operates:

* independently from the platform,
* transparently and on-chain,
* without replacing existing payment infrastructure.

#### A concrete (very realistic) example

**Peer-to-peer payment dispute**

* Amount: 200 USDC
* Sender claims: *“I paid for a service that was never delivered”*
* Receiver claims: *“The service was provided as agreed”*

With Justly:

* Both parties submit:
  * payment proof,
  * conversation history,
  * any service confirmation.
* Jurors assess:
  * Was the payment conditional?
  * Was the service delivered?
* A vote is taken.
* Funds are reassigned automatically according to the ruling.

The wallet or fintech platform **does not intervene directly**.

***

#### Clear benefits for fintechs and wallets

**For the platform**

* Lower dispute handling and chargeback costs.
* Reduced regulatory and reputational risk.
* Transparent, auditable dispute outcomes.
* Better scalability as transaction volume grows.

**For users**

* Increased confidence when sending payments.
* Fair handling of payment conflicts.

**For merchants and recipients**

* Protection against abusive chargebacks.
* Predictable, rule-based outcomes.

***

#### Why this matters

Without effective dispute resolution:

* instant payments feel risky,
* user trust declines,
* platforms become bottlenecks.

With Justly:

* disputes become structured and manageable,
* trust scales with transaction volume,
* payment systems remain fast without sacrificing fairness.

***

*Payment-related disputes are usually resolved using **Tier 1 or Tier 2**, prioritizing speed and predictable resolution times.*
