description: "A tier defines the security level, cost, and robustness of a dispute in Justly."
---

A **tier** defines the **security level, cost, and robustness** of a dispute in Justly.

In the current implementation, the same goals are achieved through configurable courts/categories.
Standardized tier profiles are part of the protocol roadmap.

Tiers allow the protocol to adapt to different types of conflicts by balancing:

* resolution speed,
* required level of trust,
* and the economic risk assumed by both parties and jurors.

Each dispute is executed within a specific tier, and all rules of the resolution process are determined by that tier.

***

### What Changes Between Tiers

#### 1. Number of Jurors

Each tier defines how many human jurors participate in resolving a dispute.

* Lower tiers use fewer jurors, enabling faster and lower-cost resolutions.
* Higher tiers use more jurors, increasing diversity of judgment and reducing the likelihood of biased outcomes.

A higher number of jurors increases the robustness of the result against individual errors or adversarial behavior.

***

#### 2. Stakes

Tiers establish the **required stake amounts** for both:

* the parties involved in the dispute (claimer and defender),
* and the jurors participating in the vote.

Higher stakes:

* increase the cost of malicious behavior,
* raise the economic commitment of participants,
* and better align incentives when the value or complexity of the dispute is higher.

Stake determines economic exposure and incentives for participation.

***

#### 3. Security Level

The security level of a dispute increases as the tier becomes higher.

This is driven by the combination of:

* a larger number of jurors,
* higher economic stakes,
* and a greater total cost required to manipulate the outcome.

Together, these factors make higher tiers more suitable for:

* higher-value disputes,
* more complex cases,
* or situations where an additional level of confidence is required.

***

### Tier System Design

Tiers do not exist to segment users, but to **offer security options proportional to the risk of a given conflict**.

In the current implementation:

* tiers are **fixed and predefined by the protocol**,
* all disputes within the same tier follow exactly the same rules,
* and outcomes are executed automatically and verifiably on-chain.

This design ensures predictable behavior for both individual users and platforms integrating Justly.
