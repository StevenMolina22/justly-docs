Justly supports multiple types of human judgment, depending on the nature of the conflict or evaluation being performed.

Each dispute type defines:

* how participants interact,
* how jurors evaluate information,
* and how outcomes are enforced on-chain.

Not all dispute types are available in the current implementation.\
This section describes the **full design of the protocol** and clearly indicates the status of each type.

| Types               | Purpose                                                      | Outcome            | Status  |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------ | ------- |
| Adversarial Dispute | *Resolve conflicts between two parties*                       | *Winner/Loser*     | Live    |
| Decision Dispute    | *Validate proposals or decisions*                             | *Accept/Reject*    | Planned |
| Rating Evaluation   | *Evaluate quality or contribution*                            | *Aggregated Score* | Planned |

### Adversarial Dispute

**Status:** Live (Current Implementation)

Resolves conflicts between two opposing parties: a **Claimer** and a **Defender**.

Jurors evaluate evidence submitted by both sides and vote on a binding outcome that is enforced on-chain.

Used for:

* marketplaces,
* freelancer and contractor platforms,
* fintech and payment disputes,
* peer-to-peer conflicts.

→ *See: Adversarial Dispute*

***

### Decision Dispute

**Status:** Planned

Designed for collective decision-making rather than conflict resolution.

Jurors evaluate whether a proposal or action should be accepted or rejected according to predefined rules.

Used for:

* governance processes,
* protocol-level decisions,
* structured human validation.

→ *See: Decision Dispute*

***

### Rating Evaluation

**Status:** Planned

A collective evaluation mechanism based on structured numerical input rather than binary outcomes.

Jurors provide ratings that are aggregated to measure quality, performance, or contribution.

Used for:

* open-source contribution evaluation,
* content moderation,
* quality and performance scoring,
* reputation systems.

→ *See: Rating Evaluation*

<Note>
Some dispute types may support additional evaluation rounds under stricter conditions.

### Extensibility

Justly is designed as a modular protocol.

Additional dispute types and variations can be introduced over time without changing the core execution or incentive model.
