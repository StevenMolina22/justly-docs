Not all judgments involve a conflict between two opposing parties.

Some situations require a **collective human decision** to validate whether an action, proposal, or outcome should be accepted or rejected.

**Decision disputes** are designed for these cases.

***

### Overview

A decision dispute enables **structured collective judgment** over a proposal or action.

Instead of resolving a conflict between two parties, jurors evaluate whether a submitted proposal is **valid, acceptable, and well-defined** according to predefined rules.

The outcome is enforced automatically on-chain.

***

### When to use a Decision Dispute

Decision disputes are suitable when:

* no direct adversarial conflict exists,
* a proposal must be validated by human judgment,
* or automated rules are insufficient or ambiguous.

Typical use cases include:

* governance and protocol decisions,
* validation of sensitive actions,
* structured approval workflows,
* human review of edge cases.

***

### Participants

#### Proposer

The proposer submits a proposal, action, or decision for evaluation.

The proposer:

* defines the proposal to be evaluated,
* deposits a **bond**,
* and accepts the outcome determined by jurors.

The proposer is **never a juror** in their own decision dispute.

***

#### Jurors

Independent participants selected through randomized assignment.

Jurors:

* evaluate the proposal according to the dispute rules,
* vote independently,
* and are economically incentivized to act coherently.

Jurors are not influenced by the proposer and have no special privileges.

***

### Decision Outcomes

Decision disputes produce one of the following outcomes:

#### Accept

The proposal is considered valid and acceptable.

The protocol executes the accepted action or records the decision accordingly.

***

#### Reject

The proposal is considered invalid, poorly defined, or unsuitable for evaluation.

Reject does **not** mean:

> “refund the proposer”

Reject means:

> “the proposal should not be accepted in its current form.”

In this case, the proposer’s bond is used to:

* compensate jurors,
* and cover protocol costs.

This mechanism discourages biased, low-quality, or malformed proposals without giving proposers special influence.

***

### Bond Mechanism

The proposer deposits a bond when opening a decision dispute.

The bond serves to:

* discourage spam or biased proposals,
* align incentives between proposers and jurors,
* and compensate jurors in case of rejection.

If:

* no clear majority is reached,
* or a rejection threshold is met,

the bond may be redistributed according to the dispute rules.

***

### Dispute Flow (High Level)

1. The proposer submits a proposal and deposits a bond.
2. Jurors are assigned to the dispute.
3. Jurors evaluate the proposal and vote.
4. The protocol determines the outcome.
5. The result is executed automatically on-chain.

All steps follow predefined rules enforced by smart contracts.

***

### Guarantees

Decision disputes in Justly provide:

* **Impartial evaluation**: proposers do not influence voting.
* **Economic discipline**: bonds discourage malformed proposals.
* **Transparent execution**: outcomes are enforced on-chain.
* **Predictable structure**: decision rules are defined upfront.

Justly does not interpret proposals or intervene in decisions.

***

### Status

**Planned**

Decision disputes are part of the core protocol design and will be introduced in a future implementation phase.
