Jurors are independent human participants responsible for resolving disputes in Justly.

They act as neutral decision-makers, evaluating evidence and casting votes according to their honest judgment.\
The protocol is designed so that jurors are economically incentivized to vote coherently and independently.

***

#### Who Can Be a Juror

Any eligible participant who meets the protocol’s requirements may act as a juror.

Jurors:

* can be gated by identity and anti-Sybil mechanisms depending on deployment profile,
* participate anonymously with respect to the disputing parties,
* and must actively opt in to each dispute they join.

Jurors cannot participate in disputes in which they are directly involved.

***

#### Role and Responsibilities

Jurors are responsible for:

* reviewing the evidence submitted by both parties,
* applying their own judgment based on the dispute context,
* and submitting a vote within the defined voting phases.

Jurors do not communicate with each other during the dispute and have no visibility into other jurors’ votes until the process concludes.

***

#### Stakes and Economic Exposure

To participate in a dispute, jurors are required to deposit a stake defined by the selected tier.

This stake:

* represents economic exposure to the outcome,
* aligns juror incentives with honest participation,
* and discourages low-effort or malicious behavior.

Staking defines economic exposure and reinforces honest participation.

***

#### Rewards and Penalties

Jurors who vote coherently with the final outcome are rewarded.

Jurors who vote against the final outcome lose part or all of their stake, depending on the dispute type and tier.

This reward and penalty structure:

* reinforces honest decision-making,
* penalizes random or adversarial voting,
* and ensures long-term incentive alignment within the juror pool.

***

#### Independence and Neutrality

Jurors are selected independently and randomly.

The protocol ensures that:

* disputing parties cannot choose their jurors,
* jurors cannot influence assignment or outcomes,
* and all economic flows are enforced automatically by smart contracts.

Jurors do not have discretionary power beyond their individual vote.

***

#### Jurors in the Ecosystem

Jurors are a core component of the Justly ecosystem.

By participating in disputes, jurors:

* help maintain trust in digital platforms,
* contribute to fair and transparent outcomes,
* and earn rewards by providing honest human judgment.

The protocol is designed to scale the juror pool over time while preserving neutrality, reliability, and economic incentives.
