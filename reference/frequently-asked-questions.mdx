### General

<details>

<summary>Can you really trust a decision made by anonymous jurors?</summary>

Justly extends the same incentive logic used in cryptoeconomic systems to human judgment.

Jurors are:

* **independent**,
* **randomly assigned**,
* and **economically incentivized** to vote coherently.

Because outcomes affect real value, the system is designed so that **dishonest or low-effort behavior is costly**, while coherent behavior is rewarded.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Is Justly a court or a legal arbitrator?</summary>

No. Justly is **neutral dispute resolution infrastructure**.

It is not a court and does not provide legal advice. It enforces outcomes based on protocol rules and smart contract execution.

(See: *Legal & Compliance Considerations*)

</details>

<details>

<summary>What kinds of disputes is Justly built for?</summary>

Justly is optimized for **micro-to-medium disputes** in digital platforms, where:

* disputes are frequent,
* amounts are not large enough for traditional legal processes,
* and fast resolution matters.

Examples include marketplaces, freelance platforms, fintech/payment conflicts, governance validation, and quality evaluation.

(See: *Use Cases*)

</details>

<details>

<summary>Is Justly only for Stellar?</summary>

No. Justly is designed to be **chain-agnostic**, although it may prioritize specific ecosystems depending on adoption and integration demand.

</details>

### How Justly Works

<details>

<summary>What is a Tier?</summary>

A tier defines the **security level and economic parameters** of a dispute: number of jurors, required stakes, and overall robustness.

Higher tiers increase the cost of manipulation by combining:

* more jurors,
* higher stakes,
* higher total cost to attack.

(See: *What is a Tier*)

</details>

<details>

<summary>How long does a dispute take?</summary>

Resolution time depends on:

* tier (number of jurors),
* evidence/voting windows,
* and juror availability.

Justly is designed to keep dispute resolution **predictable and reliable**, prioritizing liveness and completion.

(See: *Dispute Lifecycle*)

</details>

<details>

<summary>What happens after the dispute is resolved?</summary>

Once the dispute is resolved, the outcome is **executed automatically on-chain**:

* funds are redistributed according to the ruling,
* juror incentives are settled programmatically,
* and the final state becomes publicly verifiable.

</details>

### Jurors

<details>

<summary>Are jurors anonymous?</summary>

Jurors are pseudonymous participants, but Justly can require **Proof-of-Humanity (PoH)** to prevent sybil attacks.

This means jurors can remain private while still proving they are unique humans.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Why require Proof-of-Humanity (PoH)?</summary>

Without PoH, a malicious actor could create many identities and try to influence outcomes.

PoH increases security by ensuring:

* one human = one juror identity,
* and the economic cost to manipulate results becomes substantially higher.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Can parties be jurors in their own dispute?</summary>

No. Parties cannot serve as jurors in disputes where they have a direct interest.

This avoids conflicts of interest and preserves neutrality.

</details>

<details>

<summary>What if jurors don’t vote or go inactive?</summary>

Jurors are expected to participate within defined time windows.

Non-participation can result in:

* losing the chance to earn rewards,
* and protocol-defined penalties depending on the rules of the dispute.

</details>

### Security & Incentives

<details>

<summary>Can someone “whale” attack Justly by staking a lot?</summary>

Stakes affect:

* economic exposure,
* and rewards/penalties.

Large stakes increase financial exposure, but do not create special control over final execution rules.

(See: *Security Model*)

</details>

<details>

<summary>Can someone bribe jurors?</summary>

Bribery is made difficult by:

* randomized assignment,
* pseudonymity,
* and incentive alignment (jurors who vote incoherently are penalized).

Because jurors are not known in advance, targeted bribery becomes harder, and dishonest coordination is economically risky.

(See: *Security Model*)

</details>

<details>

<summary>What prevents sybil attacks?</summary>

Justly mitigates sybil attacks through:

* **Proof-of-Humanity (PoH)** eligibility,
* randomized juror assignment,
* and economic penalties for incoherent voting.

(See: *Security Model*)

</details>

<details>

<summary>Can Justly be fully trustless if matchmaking uses a backend?</summary>

Justly can use **backend-assisted matchmaking** to ensure disputes reach the required number of jurors and resolve reliably.

The backend:

* coordinates assignment and timing,
* but **cannot influence votes, outcomes, or fund execution**.

All rulings and transfers are enforced by smart contracts.

In the long-term, Justly can support multiple modes such as “Turbo” (assisted) and “Pure Randomness” (fully on-chain randomness).

(See: *Security Model*)

</details>

### Appeals

<details>

<summary>Does Justly support appeals?</summary>

Appeals are part of Justly’s protocol design and may be enabled depending on dispute type and implementation phase.

In adversarial disputes, appeal rounds can be opened under stricter conditions to increase robustness and security.

</details>

<details>

<summary>How are appeals funded?</summary>

In adversarial disputes, Justly follows a funding model where:

* the appellant pays the cost to open a new round,
* while the non-appellant may optionally “match” to preserve upside.

This discourages frivolous appeals while keeping escalation possible when needed.

(See: *Adversarial Dispute*)

</details>

### Integrations

<details>

<summary>Do users need to hold a specific token to use Justly?</summary>

No. Regular users (claimer/defender) do not need to hold a protocol token.

Justly is designed to work with **standard assets (e.g., stablecoins)** used for stakes and payouts.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Do I need the SDK to integrate Justly?</summary>

Not necessarily. Justly can be integrated through direct contract interaction and integration guidelines.

The SDK is planned to simplify and standardize integrations over time.

(See: *Current Implementation*)

</details>

<details>

<summary>Who is responsible for compliance when integrating Justly?</summary>

Compliance depends on the integrating platform, jurisdiction, and transaction type.

Justly is neutral infrastructure and can be combined with identity/KYC/AML solutions when required.

(See: *Legal & Compliance Considerations*)

</details>

### Legal & Responsibility

<details>

<summary>Who is responsible if a verdict causes economic loss?</summary>

Justly is provided “as-is”.

Outcomes result from:

* independent human judgment,
* and protocol-defined rules executed on-chain.

Users and integrators are responsible for determining whether Justly is appropriate for their use case and risk tolerance.

(See: *Legal & Compliance Considerations*)

</details>

<details>

<summary>Are Justly rulings legally binding?</summary>

Justly outcomes are **programmatically binding** because parties opt into on-chain enforcement.

They are not court rulings and do not automatically constitute legal judgments unless an integrator explicitly frames them within a legal agreement at the application layer.

</details>
