Justly is designed as a **cryptoeconomic dispute resolution protocol**, where security emerges from incentive alignment, economic cost, and transparent execution — not from authority or legal enforcement.

This section describes the **security assumptions, guarantees, and limits** of the protocol.

***

### Security Philosophy

Justly does not attempt to determine absolute truth or legal correctness.

Instead, it is designed to ensure that:

* dishonest behavior is economically costly,
* coordinated manipulation is difficult and expensive,
* and honest participation is the most rational strategy over time.

Security in Justly is achieved through **game theory, staking mechanics, and protocol-enforced execution**, not through trust in any centralized actor.

***

### Threats Justly Is Designed to Mitigate

Justly is explicitly designed to mitigate the following classes of attacks:

#### Sybil Attacks

Mitigated through:

* economic staking requirements,
* proof-of-humanity and identity primitives (where enabled),
* and cost proportional to participation.

Creating many identities does not grant proportional influence, only proportional risk.

***

#### Vote Manipulation and Collusion

Mitigated through:

* random juror selection,
* commit–reveal voting,
* incoherent vote slashing,
* and tier-based security escalation.

Collusion requires sustained coordination across multiple rounds and jurors, increasing economic exposure.

***

#### Bribery and Coercion

Mitigated through:

* juror anonymity,
* delayed vote revelation,
* and lack of pre-commitment visibility.

Bribery becomes unreliable because outcomes cannot be verified before execution.

***

#### Low-Quality or Random Voting

Mitigated through:

* loss of stake for incoherent votes,
* rewards only for alignment with final outcomes,
* and long-term negative expectancy for careless behavior.

Jurors who do not evaluate evidence are economically penalized over time.

***

### Incentive Alignment as the Primary Defense

Justly’s primary security mechanism is **incentive alignment**, not identity or reputation alone.

Key properties:

* Jurors are economically exposed to the quality of their decisions.
* Economic exposure scales risk and reward.
* Rewards are only distributed to jurors who align with the final outcome.

This structure discourages whales, favors independent judgment, and aligns rational behavior with protocol integrity.

***

### Tier-Based Security Escalation

Justly supports multiple security levels to match guarantees with dispute risk.

Higher security levels provide:

* broader juror participation,
* higher total economic exposure,
* and increased resistance to manipulation.

This allows users and integrators to choose a security level proportional to the value and complexity of the dispute.

***

### Appeals as a Security Amplifier

Appeals are a **core security layer** in the Justly design, increasing the cost of incorrect or adversarial outcomes.

In the live contracts today, disputes finalize in a single round once executed.
Appeals are one of the most urgent roadmap priorities and are designed to be introduced as structured escalation rounds.

Planned appeal rounds:

* increases juror count and economic exposure,
* re-evaluates the dispute under stricter conditions,
* and incentivizes early honest voting.

Appeals are designed to converge outcomes toward coherent judgments without granting unilateral power to any party.

***

### Limits of the System

Justly makes the following guarantees:

* outcomes are enforced exactly as defined,
* rules are transparent and immutable,
* execution is on-chain and verifiable.

Justly does **not** guarantee:

* legal correctness,
* absolute truth,
* or immunity from all forms of coordination under extreme conditions.

Human judgment is inherently probabilistic. Justly guarantees that **dishonesty is costly**, not impossible.

***

### Progressive Security

Security in Justly increases through:

* higher security levels,
* appeals,
* identity primitives,
* and protocol adoption scale.

The protocol is designed to remain secure under realistic conditions and to strengthen as participation grows.
