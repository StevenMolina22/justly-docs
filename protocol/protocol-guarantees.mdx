Justly is designed to provide enforceable, predictable outcomes in environments where trust breaks down.

Regardless of the dispute type or implementation phase, Justly guarantees:

**1. Neutrality**

* Justly does not interpret evidence.
* Justly does not influence jurors.
* Outcomes are determined exclusively by independent human judgment.

**2. Incentive Alignment**

* Jurors are economically incentivized to act coherently.
* Malicious or incoherent behavior is penalized by design.
* No participant has privileged influence over outcomes.

**3. Deterministic Execution**

* Once a dispute is resolved, outcomes are enforced automatically.
* Funds and actions are executed on-chain.
* No off-chain authority can override results.

**4. Liveness**

* Disputes are designed to reach resolution.
* The protocol prioritizes completion over indefinite stalling.
* No funds can remain locked indefinitely by design.

**5. Transparency and Auditability**

* All dispute rules are defined upfront.
* Outcomes are verifiable.
* Execution is deterministic and inspectable.
