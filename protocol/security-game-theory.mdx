Justly is secure not because it trusts people, but because it **aligns incentives**.

Instead of relying on centralized authorities, internal support teams, or subjective moderation, Justly uses **game theory** to make honest behavior the most economically rational strategy for all participants.

This is the same principle that powers:

* financial markets,
* prediction markets like Polymarket,
* decentralized arbitration systems like Kleros.

In all these systems, **truth emerges not from goodwill, but from incentives**.

***

### Trust doesn’t scale. Incentives do.

Traditional dispute resolution systems rely on trust:

* trust in companies,
* trust in moderators,
* trust in internal processes.

This model breaks down at scale.

As platforms grow:

* disputes increase,
* operational costs explode,
* decisions become inconsistent,
* users lose trust.

Justly replaces trust in institutions with **trust in economic incentives**.

***

### How Justly uses game theory

Justly is designed so that **dishonest behavior is economically irrational**.

Jurors are not expected to be altruistic.\
They are expected to be rational.

The system rewards jurors who vote coherently with reality and penalizes those who don’t.

#### The core mechanism

1. A dispute is opened.
2. Jurors are randomly selected from a large pool.
3. Each juror stakes value (e.g. USDC) to participate.
4. Jurors independently evaluate the evidence.
5. Jurors submit a vote.
6. The majority decision becomes the verdict.
7. Jurors who voted with the majority are rewarded.
8. Jurors who voted against the majority lose part of their stake.

The result is simple:

> **The most profitable strategy is to vote honestly.**

***

### Why jurors don’t vote randomly or maliciously

From an economic perspective:

* Voting randomly → expected loss.
* Voting maliciously → expected loss.
* Trying to manipulate outcomes → expensive and risky.
* Voting honestly → maximizes expected return.

Collusion is difficult because:

* juror selection is random,
* pools are large,
* coordination costs are high,
* the cost of manipulation often exceeds the dispute value.

At scale, **honesty becomes the dominant strategy**.

***

### Justly works like a market for truth

Justly follows the same logic used by prediction markets such as **Polymarket**.

Polymarket does not verify outcomes manually.\
It relies on participants risking capital on what they believe is correct.

Those who align with reality earn.\
Those who don’t, lose.

Over time, the system converges toward accurate outcomes because **being wrong is costly**.

Justly applies this logic to dispute resolution.

Instead of betting on future events, jurors stake value on:

* what is fair,
* what is correct,
* what best matches the evidence.

This turns dispute resolution into a **market-driven process for discovering truth**.

### Why this is safe for companies

From a company’s perspective, Justly provides strong security guarantees:

#### Incentive-aligned decisions

No internal bias. No “judge and party” problem.\
Jurors are economically motivated to decide fairly.

#### Predictable outcomes

Jurors behave rationally under clear incentives, producing consistent results over time.

#### Economic attack resistance

Manipulating outcomes is costly and irrational unless the attacker is willing to lose more than they gain.

#### Auditability and transparency

All decisions, votes, and outcomes are verifiable and traceable.

#### Operational scalability

Dispute resolution scales without growing internal support or arbitration teams.

***

### What Justly does *not* promise

Justly does not claim to:

* eliminate disputes,
* guarantee perfect decisions,
* remove all bad actors.

Instead, Justly guarantees that:

* dishonest behavior is penalized,
* honest behavior is rewarded,
* and the system converges toward fair outcomes over time.

This is the same guarantee provided by markets, insurance systems, and decentralized arbitration.

### The key idea

> **Justly is secure for the same reason markets are reliable: incentives beat trust.**

By aligning economic incentives with honest decision-making, Justly enables fast, scalable, and fair dispute resolution — without relying on centralized authority.

***

### Why this matters

As digital platforms scale globally, disputes become inevitable.

Justly doesn’t try to prevent conflict.\
It ensures that conflict **doesn’t break the system**.

By embedding game-theoretic security at the core, Justly becomes a reliable foundation for payments, platforms, governance, and coordination in the digital economy.
