Justly is a neutral dispute resolution infrastructure designed to facilitate human judgment and on-chain execution.\
It is not a court, not a legal arbitrator, and does not provide legal advice.

***

### 1. Role of the Protocol

Justly:

* provides tools for human dispute resolution,
* enforces outcomes programmatically,
* and operates as neutral infrastructure.

Justly does not:

* interpret laws,
* determine legal liability,
* or replace legal systems.

***

### 2. Arbitration vs. Legal Proceedings

Disputes resolved through Justly:

* are not court rulings,
* do not constitute legal judgments,
* and do not replace formal arbitration unless explicitly agreed by the parties.

Justly enables **contractual dispute resolution**, not statutory enforcement.

***

### 3. Jurisdiction and Governing Rules

Justly operates as a decentralized protocol.

Disputes are governed by **protocol-defined rules and smart contract logic**, which act as the primary source of authority for resolution and execution.

Unless an integrating platform explicitly specifies additional legal terms at the application layer, the protocol itself does not define or enforce jurisdictional law.

***

### 4. Jurors and Responsibility

Jurors:

* act as independent participants,
* express personal judgment based on provided evidence,
* and are not agents, employees, or representatives of Justly.

Justly does not endorse, validate, or assume responsibility for individual juror decisions.

***

### 5. Compliance and Integrations

Compliance requirements:

* depend on the integrating platform,
* the applicable jurisdiction,
* and the nature of the underlying transaction.

Justly is designed to integrate with:

* identity and verification solutions,
* KYC/AML providers,
* and compliance frameworks,

when required by integrators or ecosystem rules.

***

### 6. Regulatory Scope

Justly does not:

* custody user funds beyond protocol execution,
* provide financial or legal advice,
* or operate as a regulated financial intermediary.

Responsibility for regulatory compliance remains with:

* platforms integrating Justly,
* or users deploying it in regulated environments.

***

### 7. User Responsibility and “As-Is” Disclaimer

Justly is provided on an **“as-is”** basis.

Outcomes result from:

* independent human judgment,
* and protocol-defined rules executed automatically.

Users and integrators are responsible for:

* assessing whether Justly is appropriate for their use case,
* understanding the economic and operational risks involved,
* and determining how dispute outcomes should be interpreted within their own legal or business context.

***

### 8. Transparency and Auditability

All dispute rules and outcomes are:

* defined upfront,
* enforced by smart contracts,
* and publicly verifiable on-chain.

This transparency supports:

* auditability,
* accountability,
* and regulatory review where applicable.
