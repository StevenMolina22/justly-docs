The following section describes the scope of the current MVP implementation. Other sections of the documentation describe the full Justly protocol design beyond the current implementation.

#### Scope

The current implementation focuses on validating the core mechanics of Justly:

* Human juries
* Economic incentives based on game theory
* Automated on-chain execution
* Fast and reliable dispute resolution for low-to-medium value conflicts

All features outside this scope are intentionally excluded from the MVP and will be introduced in future phases.

***

#### Supported Dispute Type

**Public Adversarial Dispute**

The MVP supports **public adversarial disputes** between two parties:

* **Claimer**: the party initiating the dispute
* **Defender**: the counterparty

Both parties:

* submit evidence,
* stake funds,
* and accept the outcome enforced by the protocol.

The dispute is resolved by a group of anonymous human jurors.

***

#### Dispute Lifecycle

Each dispute follows a deterministic, on-chain lifecycle:

1. **Dispute Creation**\
   A dispute is created by the claimer, specifying the counterparty and dispute parameters.
2. **Funding & Evidence Submission**\
   Both parties deposit the required stake and submit evidence (off-chain, referenced on-chain).
3. **Juror Assignment**\
   Jurors are selected and assigned to the dispute.
4. **Commit Phase**\
   Jurors commit their votes using a commit–reveal scheme.
5. **Reveal Phase**\
   Jurors reveal their votes.
6. **Resolution & Execution**\
   The protocol determines the winning side and automatically executes:
   * fund redistribution,
   * juror rewards,
   * and penalties.

Current implementation: once executed, the outcome is final.
Roadmap priority: add appeal rounds as a first-class escalation mechanism.

***

#### Jurors

* Jurors are human participants selected through protocol-defined assignment.
* Identity and anti-Sybil layers are part of the broader roadmap.
* Jurors are pseudonymous to disputing parties.
* Jurors must stake funds to participate.

***

#### Matchmaking

Justly uses coordination mechanisms to improve liveness and operational reliability. This coordination is designed to:

* reduce stalled or abandoned disputes,
* improve timing predictability for platforms and users,
* and adapt to available juror liquidity.

Juror selection remains randomized and independent, and outcome execution remains on-chain.

Operational timing is most predictable when juror liquidity is healthy in the relevant court/category.
Longer windows remain in place as safety buffers for periods of lower participation.

***

#### Voting & Security

* Voting is executed **fully on-chain**.
* A **commit–reveal scheme** is used to prevent vote manipulation.
* Roadmap: integrate Shutter's API to support encrypted commit–reveal with automatic reveal.
* All state transitions and outcomes are verifiable on-chain.

***

#### Tiers

Roadmap: Justly introduces standardized dispute tiers.

Current implementation: disputes are configured through courts/categories and dispute parameters.

Each tier defines:

* number of jurors,
* juror stake requirements,
* party stake requirements,
* fixed fees and protocol fees.

Tiers allow the protocol to support different levels of dispute complexity and economic risk while maintaining predictable resolution behavior.

***

#### Economics

* Both disputing parties stake funds to participate.
* Jurors stake funds to vote.
* Jurors who vote coherently are rewarded.
* Jurors who vote against the final outcome lose their stake.
* The protocol charges a fixed fee per dispute and a percentage of the losing juror pool.

All economic flows are enforced automatically by smart contracts.

***

#### Limitations of the Current Implementation

The following features are **not included** in the current implementation:

* Appeals or dispute escalation
* Private disputes
* Rating or decision-based disputes
* Automatic reveal via Shutter API integration

These features are part of the Justly protocol design and will be introduced in future phases.

***

#### Design Philosophy

The current implementation prioritizes:

* correctness over completeness,
* reliability
* and enforceable outcomes over subjective mediation.

This approach allows Justly to validate its core assumptions while preserving a clear path toward progressive decentralization and additional dispute types.
