Justly is a **decentralized, on-demand dispute resolution system**, designed for digital platforms that process user-to-user payments and need a fast, impartial, and transparent way to resolve conflicts.

Unlike traditional systems—slow, manual, and centralized—Justly enables disputes to be resolved in **hours**, and often in minutes when jurors are highly available, through distributed jurors, clear economic incentives, and automatic execution of outcomes.

Justly functions as a **universal trust module** that can be integrated into fintechs, marketplaces, wallets, exchanges, service platforms, and Web3 applications, without forcing these platforms to act as judge and jury.

### A new way to resolve digital disputes

In Justly, every dispute follows a simple and predictable flow:

1. **One party initiates a dispute** and locks the disputed funds.
2. **A group of impartial jurors is selected** randomly.
3. **Jurors review the evidence and vote** within a short time window.
4. **The verdict is executed automatically**, releasing the funds according to the final decision.

The entire process is designed to minimize friction, remove intermediaries, and provide a clear experience for both end users and platforms.

### Real-time resolution, not endless processes

Justly introduces a **real-time resolution model**:

* Disputes are designed to resolve in hours, and can resolve in minutes when jurors respond quickly.
* Time windows are intentionally conservative safety buffers to protect liveness under lower activity.
* Resolution timing becomes more predictable as juror liquidity deepens in each court/category.
* Appeals are central to the protocol design and are one of the most urgent roadmap priorities.

This approach makes Justly viable even for **microtransactions**, where legal systems or traditional customer support processes are economically unfeasible.

### Distributed jurors and aligned incentives

Decisions in Justly do not depend on a company, moderator, or centralized authority.

Jurors:

* Are selected randomly from an open pool.
* Participate by staking stablecoins (USDC).
* Earn rewards for voting coherently with consensus.
* Build reputation over time.

This design incentivizes honest behavior and reduces malicious actions, without requiring prior trust between the parties.

***

### Designed for real users

Justly is not built only for blockchain experts.

The system prioritizes:

* **Simple, understandable UX**
* Fast onboarding with minimal crypto friction
* Clear interfaces for submitting evidence and understanding verdicts
* **Light gamification elements** that make the juror experience intuitive

The goal is for any user of a digital platform to use Justly without needing to understand smart contracts.

***

### A protocol, not a closed platform

Justly does not compete with existing platforms—it **empowers them**.

It acts as a neutral dispute resolution layer that can:

* Be integrated via SDKs or APIs
* Resolve conflicts tied to on-chain payments
* Execute decisions programmatically
* Maintain public traceability and transparency

In this way, Justly positions itself as core infrastructure for the digital economy, where trust is enforced by clear, verifiable rules rather than intermediaries.

***

### In summary

Justly is a lightweight digital justice system that resolves disputes in a way that is:

* ⚡ Fast (typically hours, sometimes minutes)
* ⚖️ Impartial (distributed jurors)
* 🔍 Transparent (verifiable rules and execution)
* 🌍 Global (built for digital payments and stablecoins)

It represents a new approach to resolving conflicts on the internet—aligned with the speed and scale of the modern digital economy.

> **While Justly is primarily designed for real-time dispute resolution, its incentive and coordination model can be extended to other forms of subjective evaluation—such as contribution assessment and reward allocation in open-source and digital ecosystems.**
