This page walks through a real dispute resolved on Justly, using the mobile app and real wallets. The goal is simple: show how dispute resolution works in practice, from a juror’s point of view.

### This is a real dispute resolved on Justly, step by step, from a juror’s perspective

[Watch the demo on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IuphbBqYQ4)

<Note>
The demo was recorded on mainnet.\
To keep it safe and accessible, the amounts used are small, but the mechanics are exactly the same as in real-world disputes.
</Note>

#### **The dispute**

The dispute shown in the video is **Dispute #9**, titled:

**“Freelance Work Not Paid”**

Two parties are involved:

* **Julio Banegas** (claimant), who states that freelance work was completed but not paid.
* **Micaela Descotte** (defendant), who disputes the claim.

Both sides submitted evidence directly through Justly.\
As a juror, you see the same information any independent reviewer would see: descriptions, attachments, and context.

***

#### **Jurors joining the dispute**

In this demo, the same person participates as a juror using **three different wallets**, each one connected through a separate MetaMask account.

This is done only for demonstration purposes, to clearly show how majority and minority outcomes work.

For each wallet:

1. The juror opts in to the dispute.
2. A small amount of USDC is staked to participate.
3. The dispute appears in the juror’s **current portfolio**, indicating active participation.

At this stage, the juror has skin in the game.

***

#### **Voting phase**

Each wallet votes independently, based only on the evidence presented.

* Wallet #1 votes in favor of **Julio Banegas**
* Wallet #2 votes in favor of **Micaela Descotte**
* Wallet #3 also votes in favor of **Micaela Descotte**

There is no coordination between wallets.\
Each vote is a standalone decision.

After voting, the dispute moves to the juror’s **Inbox**, labeled **“Reveal now”**, indicating that the commit phase has ended and the votes can be revealed.

***

#### **Reveal and outcome**

Once all votes are revealed:

* The system determines the majority decision.
* Jurors who voted with the majority are marked as **winning jurors**.
* Jurors who voted against the majority are marked as **losing jurors**.

In this case:

* The two wallets that voted for **Micaela Descotte** are in the majority.
* The wallet that voted for **Julio Banegas** is in the minority.

***

#### **Rewards and penalties**

After the dispute is resolved:

* Winning jurors receive a **“Rewards pending”** notification.
* They can claim their rewards directly from the app.
* The juror in the minority does not receive a reward.

This mechanism is intentional.

Justly does not reward being loud or early —\
it rewards being **right, relative to the collective judgment**.

***

#### **Why this matters**

This demo highlights the core principles behind Justly:

* Jurors are real participants, not automated rules.
* Decisions are driven by evidence, not authority.
* Economic incentives align behavior without requiring trust.
* Outcomes are enforced automatically.

For platforms, this means disputes can be resolved without internal arbitration.\
For users, it means fairness is not just promised — it is enforced by design.
