**Digital economies move fast, but dispute resolution hasn’t kept up.**

Most platforms today rely on centralized, opaque, and expensive processes to resolve conflicts. This creates friction, erodes trust, and doesn’t scale — especially for low and mid-value disputes where traditional legal systems are impractical.

**Justly exists to fix that.**

### A neutral layer for digital disputes

Justly is designed as a **neutral, programmable dispute resolution layer** that can be embedded into any digital platform where value is exchanged.

Instead of acting as judge and jury, platforms can delegate dispute resolution to an independent system that is:

* transparent,
* auditable,
* fast,
* and economically aligned through incentives.

### Built for stablecoins and real-world payments

Justly is optimized for **stablecoin-based economies**, where users expect:

* predictable outcomes,
* fast resolutions,
* and minimal volatility.

By using assets like USDC, Justly enables dispute resolution that feels familiar to users while remaining fully on-chain and automated.

### Human judgment, cryptographic guarantees

Not all disputes can be solved by code alone.

Justly introduces **human judgment where it matters**, but enforces outcomes with smart contracts. Jurors are economically incentivized to act honestly, and rulings are executed automatically—without intermediaries.

This creates a system that combines:

* game theory,
* cryptographic enforcement,
* and social consensus.

### Infrastructure, not a vertical product

Justly is not built for a single use case.

It is **infrastructure**:

* reusable across industries,
* adaptable to different rulesets,
* and composable with existing systems.

Marketplaces, fintechs, Web3 protocols, insurance platforms, and OSS ecosystems can all plug into the same dispute resolution core.

### Designed to scale beyond disputes

While disputes are the starting point, Justly’s core primitives—staking, voting, quality evaluation, and incentive alignment—can power other coordination problems, from governance to contribution assessment.

Justly is about trust at scale.
