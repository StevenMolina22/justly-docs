## Welcome

There are two ways to build API documentation: [OpenAPI](https://mintlify.com/docs/api-playground/openapi/setup) and [MDX components](https://mintlify.com/docs/api-playground/mdx/configuration). For the starter kit, we are using the following OpenAPI specification.

## Authentication

All endpoints require a Bearer token.

Include your API key in the `Authorization` header for every request:

```http
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

If the token is missing or invalid, the API returns `401 Unauthorized`.

This requirement is defined in the OpenAPI spec and automatically applied to the documented endpoints:

```json
"security": [
  {
    "bearerAuth": []
  }
]
```
